DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is a modified version of Unity's built-in skybox shader. It blends Unity's built-in fog color with the skybox.


HOW TO USE:
-----------

Import the custom PACKAGE into your project. (Assets > Import Packabe > Custom Package)

Use the provided skybox material, or create your own material and select the shader from "Skybox > 6 Sided Fog". 
Then set the skybox material in your environment within the Lighting panel.  
Adjust the material's properties and Unity fog settings to your liking, that's it!

If you don't want to use the 2nd color gradient, simply make it the same color as the fog color. You could also remove the lines of code from the shader containing "_ColorB".


NOTES:
------

THE EFFECT IS ONLY VISIBLE IN THE GAME VIEW WINDOW. DOES NOT WORK IN THE EDITOR VIEW.

Made with Unity 5.6.5f1, also tested successfully in Unity 2019.2.2f1 and Unity 2020.1.0b15.
